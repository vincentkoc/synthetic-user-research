# Synthetic User Research
## Persona Prompting & Autonomous Agents with Autogen Framework

## Overview

This project explores the innovative domain of synthetic user research by leveraging generative AI and autonomous agents to simulate digital customer personas. Traditional user research methodologies face challenges such as scalability and accessing diverse user groups. Our approach, using generative AI, allows for the creation and interaction with digital personas in simulated research scenarios, unlocking unprecedented insights into consumer behaviors and preferences. The notebook also has an example report card generation, you can see the example report card [EXAMPLE_REPORT.md](EXAMPLE_REPORT.md).

## Key Features

- **Persona Prompting**: Crafting detailed prompts to generate synthetic personas with rich backgrounds, goals, and frustrations.
- **Autonomous Agent Fusion**: Combining technology and linguistics to create digital personas that interact in simulated environments, mimicking real consumer interactions.
- **Advanced Research Frameworks**: Utilizing frameworks like Autogen, BabyAGI, and CrewAI to manage complex agent architectures and interactions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Installation of Autogen and other necessary libraries

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/koconder/synthetic-user-research.git
cd synthetic-user-research
```

### Running the Notebook

Open the provided Jupyter Notebook in your preferred environment, such as Jupyter Lab or Google Colab. The notebook contains detailed steps and code snippets for setting up the environment, configuring the LLM and API keys, and running the synthetic user research simulations.

## Usage

Follow the instructions within the notebook to:

1. Setup your environment and configure the Large Language Model (LLM).
2. Define personas using the persona prompting method.
3. Initialize autonomous agents and simulate user research sessions.
4. Analyze the outcomes and generate summaries using a Summary Agent.
